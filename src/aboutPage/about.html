              August 8 is International Cat Day — a day to celebrate one of
              man’s most common and ancient pets. They have even been worshiped
              as gods (we see you, Egypt.) Well, it is not surprising, Cats are
              one of the coolest beings on the planet: they are independent,
              inquisitive, adventurous, have an amazing physiognomy, and the
              power to heal by themselves — at least most of the time. Cats are
              carnivorous small furry mammals — for the most part — with four
              legs, a tail, and claws, that humans have domesticated as pets
              since ancient times, even though they have descended from the
              African Wildcat and they used to catch vermin. The first
              historical human record about cats could be found in Ancient
              Egyptian Civilization’s culture. We all seem to relate cats with
              Egyptians, because of their adoration and consideration of cats as
              gods. Mafdet was the first known cat deity and was regarded as the
              protector against snakes, scorpions, and evil during the First
              Dynasty, so for them, cats were not just deities, but also
              protectors.

            <p id="paragraph">
              Cats get the royal treatment on International Cat Day. Not that
              this isn’t already the case on most days, but they are especially
              pampered and showered with love today. Cats are the finickiest
              members of the family, so the day is spent catering to their every
              need; buying them their favorite treats and expensive catnip,
              letting them shred to their heart’s content, allowing them to
              wail, and even tuning in to their favorite TV show (there are
              videos on the internet of cats obediently watching “Tom and
              Jerry.”) Not every cat is lucky enough to have a good home where
              it enjoys a lavish lifestyle. Stray cats are subjected to cruelty
              and injuries due to car accidents and other harmful situations, so
              donations are generously made to animal shelters and welfare
              organizations. Cats are also adopted and taken to their new homes,
              especially by children who are getting their first pet.
